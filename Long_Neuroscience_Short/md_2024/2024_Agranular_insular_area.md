## 1. **Mediation of Cocaine Use and Addiction**

**Function:**  
The agranular (anterior) insular cortex (AIC) appears to be a crucial node in the development and maintenance of cocaine addiction. In rodent models, changes in functional connectivity (FC) between the AIC and retrosplenial cortex were observed before and after chronic cocaine self-administration, suggesting that baseline AIC–retrosplenial interactions may predict susceptibility to cocaine dependence. As drug exposure progresses, these connectivity patterns also shift, implying that the insular cortex is not only a moderator but a consequence of prolonged stimulant use. These findings align with broader evidence from human neuroimaging, where the AIC is considered part of the salience network heavily implicated in substance use disorders. Understanding these AIC-centered circuits could pave the way for targeted interventions aimed at disrupting the neural underpinnings of addiction.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
In rodent models of cocaine self-administration, intrinsic functional connectivity changes have been observed between the AIC and retrosplenial cortex, suggesting a predictive relationship between baseline activity and susceptibility to addiction. As cocaine use persists, these connectivity patterns further evolve, indicating both moderating and consequential roles for the AIC in chronic stimulant exposure. Similar evidence in humans suggests that the AIC’s salience-network functions contribute to drug craving and the compulsive drive to seek cocaine. These insights highlight potential therapeutic targets within AIC-related circuits to curb cocaine use and prevent relapse.

## 2. **Facilitation of Compulsion-Like Alcohol Consumption**

**Function:**  
In the context of alcohol use, the anterior insula (AIC) has been implicated in driving compulsion-like drinking behaviors, particularly those that persist despite negative consequences. Single-unit recordings in rats show distinct firing patterns in the AIC at the onset of alcohol intake and during licking bouts. Some neuronal populations increase firing in a sustained manner to maintain the “drive” for continued drinking, even through short pauses. This contrasts with reward responses for palatable fluids like saccharin, where AIC activity is often less pronounced. These findings underscore the AIC’s role in encoding motivational salience specific to alcohol and possibly other addictive substances, emphasizing a more generalized function in promoting persistent, goal-directed behaviors.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Research indicates that during voluntary alcohol consumption, specific AIC neurons in rodents become active at the start of each drinking episode, effectively “reinforcing” further intake. Their sustained firing suggests a neural correlate for compulsive behavior, as these neurons keep the drive for alcohol consumption high, even when an organism momentarily pauses its drinking. These data differentiate the AIC’s involvement in alcohol-related motivational states from responses to other rewarding substances or fluids, hinting at a specialized role in addiction processes.

## 3. **Involvement in Initiation of Persistent Movement**

**Function:**  
Although traditionally linked to interoception and affective processing, the insular cortex also participates in motor control under certain conditions. Recent evidence indicates that activity in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) projecting to the insular (and motor) cortex can initiate persistent movements in mice. When dmPFC neurons are silenced, insular-cortex activity diminishes, and animals exhibit impairments in starting or sustaining the movement sequence. However, once the movement has begun, the insula is not strictly required to maintain it. These findings broaden the scope of insular-cortex functions into the domain of motor initiation and context-dependent movement control.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
An emerging body of research shows that the AIC, in coordination with dmPFC, contributes to the transition from a resting state to an active motor state. In mice, optogenetic or chemogenetic manipulation of this circuit demonstrates that the insular cortex is critically involved at the onset of movement, ensuring that persistent locomotion or other repetitive behaviors are initiated. Interestingly, the AIC’s role seems less critical once the movement is underway, suggesting a time-sensitive contribution to motor planning and action initiation.

## 4. **Mediation of Social Preference, Especially after Social Isolation**

**Function:**  
Beyond its established roles in emotion and interoception, the insular cortex is integral to social behaviors. In mice, a population of insular neurons becomes specifically engaged in social preference following acute social isolation. Anatomical tracing and in vivo recordings show that projection patterns between bilateral insular cortices correlate with heightened sociability after deprivation. This suggests the AIC can detect or integrate internal states (e.g., isolation-induced stress) and external social stimuli to guide approach behaviors.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Studies focusing on social isolation reveal that the AIC may encode the motivational and emotional salience of social stimuli. After isolation, specific neurons in the AIC display elevated firing rates when the subject engages in social exploration or interactions with novel conspecifics. This heightened neuronal activity appears tuned to restore social contact, highlighting the AIC’s integrative role in reading internal physiological/emotional signals and orchestrating appropriate approach behaviors. Such findings underscore the adaptive function of the AIC in promoting social re-engagement following periods of isolation.

## 5. **Modulation of Pain and Antinociception**

**Function:**  
The agranular insular cortex also participates in pain processing and analgesia. In a mouse model of inflammatory pain, inhalation of lavender essential oil (LEO) elicits antinociceptive effects through heightened activation of an anterior piriform cortex (aPir) to insular cortex circuit. These findings point to a top-down cortical mechanism whereby sensory cues (LEO’s odor) engage the aPir → IC pathway to reduce pain perception. This expands the conventional view of the insula from merely encoding interoceptive signals to actively modulating pain responses, supporting potential therapeutic strategies involving insular circuits for non-pharmacological pain management.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Animal models expose how olfactory stimuli—specifically lavender essential oil—can trigger reduced pain sensitivity via cortical circuits connecting the aPir and the AIC. Neuronal recordings and inactivation studies confirm that disruption of these pathways attenuates LEO’s analgesic effect, indicating a direct cortical influence on nociceptive processing. This highlights the AIC’s broader role in integrating sensory input (such as odor) with internal pain modulatory systems, providing a potential avenue for novel, non-opioid pain therapies.
