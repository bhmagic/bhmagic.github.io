## 1. **Goal-Directed Navigation and Search Strategy Selection**

**Function:**  
Guides the selection of efficient navigational strategies to reach desired goals, helping animals switch from exploratory to more focused behaviors once multiple strategies have been sampled.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The RSC plays an essential role in learning and deploying navigational strategies to reach goals efficiently. In particular, it helps animals switch from exploratory to more focused searching behaviors, guiding the selection of the most effective solution once multiple strategies have been sampled. By integrating spatial information with potential goals, the RSC updates and refines the chosen strategy as learning progresses. This function is distinct from online moment-to-moment control (e.g., by dorsolateral striatum) but is critical for high-level directional/goal choices.

## 2. **Memory Encoding and Retrieval**

**Function:**  
Underpins the formation and recall of associative, spatial, and episodic-like memories, partly via interactions with hippocampal circuits and interneuron networks.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The RSC underpins both the formation and recall of various types of memory, including associative, spatial, and episodic-like memories. It does so partly via its interactions with the hippocampal formation and parvalbumin interneuron networks. In models of neurodegenerative disease, impairments in RSC function correlate with notable deficits in memory. This suggests that the RSC’s circuit-specific or interneuron-specific mechanisms are vital for robust encoding and subsequent retrieval of learned information.

## 3. **Integration within Large-Scale Networks and Default Mode Network (DMN)**

**Function:**  
Serves as a core node within the rodent DMN, integrating internal states with external cues and coordinating high-level cognitive processes across widespread cortical and subcortical circuits.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The RSC is often considered a core node of the rodent DMN, integrating internal state information with external cues. It exhibits strong functional connectivity changes under conditions such as chronic cocaine use or altered circadian phases. By linking with other major cortical and subcortical areas (e.g., the anterior insula, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex), the RSC coordinates high-level cognitive and “default” functions—those involved in memory, self-referential processes, and unconstrained exploration.

**Articles mentioning this function:**

## 4. **Coupling with Hippocampal Rhythms and High-Frequency Oscillations**

**Function:**  
Displays coordinated rhythmic activity with the hippocampus, including the generation of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in granular RSC that synchronize with hippocampal sharp wave-ripples and theta.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The RSC exhibits coordinated rhythmic activity with the hippocampus across various behavioral and brain states. In particular, granular RSC layer 2/3 can generate high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) that synchronize with hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs) and theta oscillations. This bidirectional communication may facilitate memory consolidation, replay of neural representations, and the integration of past experiences into ongoing behavior.

## 5. **Head Direction, Spatial Orientation, and Egocentric Coding**

**Function:**  
Encodes head direction signals and aligns them with relevant sensory or visual cues, while also representing environmental geometry in an egocentric reference frame.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The RSC is critically involved in encoding the head direction (HD) signal and aligning it with relevant sensory or visual cues. Recordings show near-synchronous HD representations in RSC and the anterodorsal thalamus. Beyond pure HD, the RSC also encodes local geometry and features in an egocentric reference frame, vital for building an internal spatial model. These representations help an animal orient in familiar and novel environments, supporting flexible navigation and reorientation to environmental changes.

**Articles mentioning this function:**  
- [38470232](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38470232/), [39271679](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39271679/), [39169030](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39169030/)

## 6. **Object-Location Associative Learning**

**Function:**  
Supports the learning and recall of specific object-location pairings, binding visual/identity cues with spatial contexts for more complex associative tasks.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The RSC is necessary for learning and remembering object-location pairings, where animals must associate a specific cue or object with a spatial position. Studies using touchscreen operant tasks in rodents reveal that RSC lesions severely impair the ability to acquire and recall new object-location associations. This role is distinct from simpler spatial working memory or pure visual discrimination, underscoring the RSC’s specialization for multi-modal or “bound” associations.

## 7. **Visual Representation and Cortico-Cortical Signaling**

**Function:**  
Drives visual representations in downstream areas (e.g., medial entorhinal cortex), modulating how sensory inputs are integrated into spatial mapping circuits.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Although long known for its role in spatial and contextual processing, the RSC can also drive visual representations in other areas such as the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). By transmitting visual information or modulating sensory signals, the RSC influences how the MEC constructs representations of external cues and integrates them with spatial maps. These circuits suggest the RSC is a pivotal upstream region shaping entorhinal coding of visual stimuli.

## 8. **Emotion Recognition and Social Information Integration**

**Function:**  
Integrates socially derived and emotional cues into an animal’s contextual framework, gating the recognition of conspecifics’ emotional states via top-down cortico-cortical signals.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Beyond spatial and memory roles, the RSC participates in processing socially derived cues and emotion-related information. In particular, it helps integrate top-down signals (e.g., from the medial prefrontal cortex) that are critical for recognizing and responding to emotional states in conspecifics. This gating function ensures that socially relevant information is properly merged with an animal’s ongoing perceptual and contextual framework.

## 9. **Modulating and Stabilizing Task-Variable Representations**

**Function:**  
Maintains certain high-level or contextual aspects of a task (e.g., context or outcome information) more stably than immediate motor variables, supporting consistent performance over time.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
In complex tasks involving multiple contextual and motor variables, RSC neurons stabilize (or maintain) certain dimensions of the task more strongly than others. For example, RSC cells can hold context and trial-outcome information over time more robustly than immediate motor choices. This hierarchical coding ensures that essential high-level or contextual factors remain consistent across days, supporting reliable performance and learning in changing environments.

## 10. **Disease-Related Alterations (Alzheimer’s Disease, Addiction)**

**Function:**  
Exhibits vulnerability in conditions like Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and shows connectivity changes with chronic drug exposure, affecting memory and default mode network dynamics.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The RSC is notably vulnerable in conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and may also undergo connectivity changes with chronic drug exposure (e.g., cocaine). In AD models, parvalbumin interneuron dysfunction and altered subiculum→RSC pathways correlate with early memory deficits. In addiction contexts, RSC connectivity within the default mode network and with salience-related areas can shift pre- and post-drug use, suggesting that RSC abnormalities might influence relapse vulnerability or cognitive decline.

Shows activity and connectivity shifts across the day/night cycle, reflecting how circadian or arousal-related states modulate RSC’s cognitive roles.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
RSC activity and connectivity can fluctuate with the day/night cycle, reflecting circadian or arousal-related modulation. Studies indicate that RSC functional connectivity patterns differ between light versus dark conditions, and these rhythms can vary by sex and age. Such fluctuations highlight how the RSC integrates physiological state (e.g., circadian signals) with its ongoing cognitive roles in memory or spatial navigation.
