## 1. **Motor Planning and Movement Control**

**Function:**  
Planning, encoding, and guiding voluntary movements (e.g., eye, hand, or reach actions).

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The PPC encodes motor intentions and translates sensory information into motor commands, serving as a key hub for planning and coordinating movements. Functional ultrasound (fUS) recordings in rhesus monkeys have demonstrated that PPC activity can be decoded to predict forthcoming eye or hand movements, highlighting its pivotal role in brain-machine interface (BMI) control. This region also integrates visual and proprioceptive cues to guide reaches toward targets, flexibly shifting between object-centered (allocentric) and body-centered (egocentric) reference frames. Such dynamic encoding supports context-dependent movement planning, allowing the brain to adapt motor strategies “on the fly.” When task demands change (e.g., object size or position), PPC neurons re-map spatial goals accordingly, illustrating how parietal circuits dynamically update plans to achieve accurate motor execution.

## 2. **Cross-Modal Predictions and Predictive Coding**

**Function:**  
Integrating top-down predictions with bottom-up inputs to resolve conflicts between expected and actual sensory information.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Within hierarchical predictive coding frameworks, the PPC helps reconcile discrepancies between what the brain predicts and what the senses report. In a mouse texture discrimination task, learned associations between an auditory cue (tone) and a tactile stimulus (texture) created top-down expectations; when a mismatch arose, PPC activity reflected competition between the predicted texture and the actual one. This competition determined whether behavior was guided by the anticipated or real stimulus. Such findings underscore the PPC’s broader role in modulating cortical networks according to current expectations and informing decision-making when there is conflict between prediction and perception.

## 3. **Numerosity and Magnitude Processing**

**Function:**  
Discriminating and representing numerical quantity independently of continuous magnitudes (e.g., size, duration).

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Research in rats demonstrates that silencing the PPC impairs numerical discrimination without equally affecting judgments of associated non-numerical magnitudes (like cumulative duration or intensity). This suggests that the PPC specifically encodes “number sense,” allowing animals (and, by extension, other species) to distinguish different counts of stimuli. Neural network modeling further indicates that the neural substrates for numerosity may be at least partly distinct from those encoding other magnitudes, emphasizing the parietal cortex’s specialized contribution to abstract quantity representation.

## 4. **Attentional Control and Value-Based Decision-Making**

**Function:**  
Guiding attention toward task-relevant stimulus features and facilitating flexible decisions based on reward outcomes.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
By working in tandem with prefrontal regions, the PPC helps form and adjust “attentional templates” that highlight relevant features while filtering out distractions. In a repeated-learning visual search paradigm, neural representations in PPC and prefrontal cortex gradually shift toward stimuli that yield higher rewards, effectively encoding “value-based” target features. This shared code not only speeds up selective attention but also translates perceptual inputs into a common currency for decision-making. When the relevant features change, the PPC incrementally updates the template, enabling rapid re-learning and adaptive behavior in dynamic contexts.

## 5. **Working Memory Maintenance and Memory-Based Biases**

**Function:**  
Storing stimulus information short-term and shaping perceptual judgments through recency and central tendency biases.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The PPC supports the retention of recent sensory inputs in working memory and mediates how new stimuli are compared to past experiences. In rodent experiments, temporarily shifting or contracting the remembered magnitude (often toward the mean of prior stimuli) is reduced if the PPC is silenced, indicating its importance in memory-based biases. These biases can be adaptive, helping the animal (or human) make better use of noisy inputs by anchoring judgments to past observations. The parietal cortex thus “remembers” both the most recent stimulus and the average of previous ones, balancing short-term recall with statistical context.

## 6. **Auditory Discrimination and Sensory Integration**

**Function:**  
Contributing to cortico-cortical networks that process auditory inputs and guide motor or attentional responses.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Although classically associated with visuomotor functions, the PPC also participates in broader multisensory and sensorimotor loops. Recordings in mice performing an auditory go/no-go discrimination task suggest that parietal activity—along with other cortical areas—can be modulated by neuromodulatory signals (e.g., from the locus coeruleus) to influence detection speed and impulsive responding. Thus, the PPC’s integrative capacity extends beyond vision and somatosensation, helping coordinate or refine motor outputs based on auditory information and top-down arousal/attention states.

## 7. **Default Mode Network (DMN) Connectivity and Higher-Level Cognition**

**Function:**  
Participating in large-scale cortical networks involved in cognition, memory, and self-referential processes.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Beyond its well-documented roles in sensorimotor transformation, the PPC also shows strong functional connectivity with frontal and temporal “default mode” regions in both humans and non-human primates. Directed seed-based connectivity analyses reveal that dorsal lateral prefrontal areas and posterior parietal cortices jointly target the cerebellum, suggesting a functional link to high-level cognitive or language-related processes. These findings highlight the PPC’s broad involvement in top-down control, introspective functions, and potential integration of external stimuli with internally generated contexts—key elements often ascribed to the DMN.
