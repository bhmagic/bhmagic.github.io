## 1. **Attentional Control and Value-Based Decision-Making**

**Function:**  
The posterior parietal association area (PPC) is critical for filtering sensory inputs and focusing on behaviorally relevant features. In concert with prefrontal networks, it encodes “attentional templates” linked to reward or task goals, adapting these templates when contingencies shift. This enables flexible deployment of attention toward valuable or salient stimuli and facilitates rapid, reward-grounded decision-making.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
- The PPC encodes and updates attentional templates for reward-associated features.  
- It helps shift these templates as task contingencies change, guiding attention toward new, more valuable stimuli.  
- This capacity links perception to working memory of stimulus features and to reward-driven selection processes.  
- Result: flexible, value-based decision-making that can rapidly adjust to changing contexts.

## 2. **Spatial Localization and Reference Frame Transformations**

**Function:**  
The PPC supports position- and scale-invariant encoding of spatial targets, switching flexibly between allocentric (object-centered) and egocentric (body-centered) frames as tasks demand. This underlies accurate goal-directed actions and context-dependent spatial cognition.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
- Neurons in the posterior parietal area can maintain object-centered memory traces while also adopting an egocentric frame during motor planning (e.g., reaching).  
- This switching capability is robust to changes in object location or size, ensuring goal-directed actions remain accurate.  
- Such dynamic reference frame transformations exemplify how dorsal-stream areas integrate visual and motor information for flexible spatial behavior.

## 3. **Integration with Neuromodulatory Systems for Attention and Perception**

**Function:**  
The PPC receives strong modulatory inputs (e.g., noradrenergic projections from the locus coeruleus), influencing cortical oscillations, arousal, and how sensory cues are prioritized. This neuromodulation shapes attention and detection performance under varying task demands.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
- Phasic LC-NE activation can alter oscillatory states in PPC, biasing the detection and processing of incoming stimuli.  
- These neuromodulatory effects optimize behavior by selectively enhancing relevant cues and influencing reaction times.  
- Coordination with fronto-parietal circuits ensures that vigilance levels and motivational states align with task requirements.

## 4. **Feedback Gating and Conscious Report**

**Function:**  
The PPC is a key intermediary in top-down feedback loops that enable conscious access and reportability of stimuli. It exerts a gating role—often described as a “final switch”—determining whether sensory signals achieve a late, report-linked wave of activity.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
- While frontal “ignition” may initiate global broadcasting, PPC appears essential for the final gating of conscious report.  
- Minimal network models suggest parietal “veto” or “enabling” steps are crucial for translating raw sensory input into behaviorally reportable signals.  
- This process integrates executive control with sensory experience, ensuring that only the most relevant stimuli gain conscious access.

## 5. **Working Memory Processes (Implications for ADHD)**

**Function:**  
The PPC is crucial for maintaining and manipulating information in short-term memory contexts. Disruptions in parietal connectivity are linked to working memory deficits, as illustrated in ADHD models where parietal-centric circuits can be modulated to improve cognition.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
- In ADHD models, abnormal PPC connectivity correlates with poor working memory and attentional performance.  
- Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) targeting these networks can restore normative connectivity, enhancing memory behavior in ADHD rodent models.  
- These findings highlight the parietal cortex’s pivotal role in sustaining attentional and mnemonic processes, and point to neuromodulation as a therapeutic strategy.

## 6. **Large-Scale Connectivity and Default Mode/Language Network Involvement**

**Function:**  
Posterior parietal association areas serve as major hubs within high-level networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal) linked to language, executive function, and internal mentation. They exert top-down influences on subcortical regions and coordinate tightly with prefrontal areas.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
- Directed connectivity analyses reveal robust parietal-to-cerebellar output, suggesting parietal shaping of subcortical processing.  
- In the DMN, parietal hubs integrate information across frontal and temporal nodes for complex cognition, mind-wandering, and meta-cognition.  
- Coordination with dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) underpins planning, conceptual reasoning, and other higher-order functions.

## 7. **Multisensory Integration, Consciousness States, and Subcortical–Cortical Bridging**

**Function:**  
The PPC integrates input across multiple sensory modalities, modulates these signals under anesthesia or altered states, and coordinates with hippocampal/presubicular circuits for higher-order spatial and mnemonic processes.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
- Parietal networks undergo measurable changes under ketamine or isoflurane anesthesia, implicating PPC in the maintenance or breakdown of conscious processing.  
- The presubiculum–parietal pathway indicates that parietal areas coordinate spatial and mnemonic integration, vital for tasks like navigation.  
- During natural vision and free eye movements, PPC helps remap or stabilize receptive fields, sustaining a coherent perceptual experience.
