## 1. **Representation of Boundary Information for Spatial Navigation**

**Function:**  
Representation of boundaries in the environment (via Boundary Vector Cells) to guide spatial navigation.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Research shows that certain subicular neurons, termed Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs), encode an animal’s location as a vector from environmental boundaries. These neurons respond to walls or barriers at specific distances and orientations, forming stable spatial firing maps that facilitate navigation. Environmental geometry—whether square or circular—alters the directional tuning and receptive fields of these cells, highlighting the role of shape-based cues. Additionally, inserted barriers evoke both excitatory and inhibitory components of these receptive fields, pointing to an interplay of multiple synaptic inputs. Developmentally, while boundary-responsive activity emerges early in entorhinal cortex, full maturation of these subicular BVCs takes longer, indicating complex, stepwise circuit refinement in postnatal life.

## 2. **Blueprint of Multi-Target Projections (Integration across Brain Regions)**

**Function:**  
Organization of widespread anatomical projections that integrate multiple cortical and subcortical regions, suggesting a hub-like role for (pre)subicular circuits.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
An unsupervised classification of presubicular projection neurons reveals distinct classes, each with different anatomical targets and divergence patterns. Some presubicular neurons send axons exclusively to hypothalamic and midbrain structures (plus agranular retrosplenial cortex), while another class selectively projects to Cornu Ammonis fields of the hippocampus (and granular retrosplenial cortex). These observations indicate that the (pre)subiculum/postsubiculum is not merely a relay but rather a sophisticated organizer of parallel pathways. Path distances to targets, specificity in convergent or divergent axon arborization, and the non-uniform distribution of soma types underscore a key integrative function in higher-order processes such as memory, navigation, and sensorimotor coordination.

## 3. **Early Impact in Alzheimer’s Disease and Role in Memory Circuits**

**Function:**  
Participation in learning and memory processes, with susceptibility to early pathological changes in Alzheimer’s disease.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The dorsal subiculum (which includes or directly connects with the postsubiculum) is among the first structures affected in Alzheimer’s disease models. Using monosynaptic rabies tracing in 5xFAD mice, researchers observed significant alterations in presynaptic inputs to the subiculum from hippocampal subfields (CA1, CA2, CA3), postsubiculum (postSUB), and associated cortices. These connectivity changes are modulated by both sex and age. Importantly, the involvement of visual cortical inputs in the subiculum suggests that seemingly “non-memory” sensory areas may contribute to memory deficits in AD. Thus, disruptions in the subiculum/postsubiculum circuitry play a key role in the progression of AD-related cognitive decline.

### Additional Notes:
- [**PMID: 38722021**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38722021/) and [**PMID: 38748876**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38748876/) were not included in the functional listings because their abstracts (as provided) do not explicitly mention the postsubiculum (or subiculum).  

**Summary:**  
From these abstracts, the postsubiculum (together with the broader subicular/presubicular complex) emerges as a critical node for (1) encoding boundary information for navigation, (2) orchestrating wide-ranging projections that likely underpin various cognitive and sensorimotor functions, and (3) serving as an early and vulnerable hub in Alzheimer’s disease-related circuit disruption.
