# Summary of 2024 Publications: Functions in Gustatory areas   

## 1. **Taste Coding and Decision Making**

**Function:**  
The gustatory cortex is responsible for encoding the identity of tastes (e.g., sweet, bitter, salty), undergoing plastic changes as an animal learns to discriminate among different taste stimuli. In trained tasks, gustatory cortex neurons adapt so that they not only respond to the taste itself but also predict the action the animal will take (e.g., whether to lick or how to respond to a flavor). These distinct “response epochs” reflect (1) recognition of the taste and (2) the animal’s upcoming decision. Thus, the gustatory cortex contributes both to taste perception and the decision-making processes linked to that taste.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
When a mouse is trained on a taste-based decision task, neural activity in the gustatory cortex shifts over time to encode both stimulus identity and the behavioral choice. Initially, neurons show selectivity for the taste itself, but as learning progresses, they also exhibit activity predictive of the mouse’s intended action. This temporal segregation—taste recognition followed by decision-related firing—reveals how the gustatory cortex bridges sensory processing and motor planning. Such plasticity underlies not just taste discrimination, but the broader integration of sensory cues with the actions they prompt.

**Note on Other Abstract ([PMID: 38848217](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38848217/))**:  
This abstract focuses on striatal projection neurons and sensorimotor cortices in complex movement “chunking.” It does not mention gustatory cortex and therefore does not contribute additional functions for gustatory areas.
