## 1. **Encoding Navigational Information**

**Function:**  
Encodes spatial navigation parameters (position, speed, future path predictions) and replays reward/event-related information during post-task sleep, serving as a critical hub for consolidating navigational events in both active exploration and subsequent rest.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The subiculum plays a pivotal role in spatial navigation by encoding positional, speed-related, and prospective path information. Its neuronal population activity is arranged in low-dimensional “neural manifolds” that map onto external space. In doing so, the subiculum can predict upcoming trajectories and process future path decisions with higher accuracy than CA1. During post-task sleep (particularly slow-wave sleep ripples), the subiculum also “replays” reward location or event-related information more frequently than the hippocampal CA1. This distinct manner of encoding indicates that the subiculum may serve as a critical hub for consolidating navigational events during both active exploration and subsequent rest.

## 2. **Driving High-Frequency Oscillations and Coupling with Retrosplenial Cortex**

**Function:**  
Generates and propagates high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the granular retrosplenial cortex (gRSC) via a hippocampus–subiculum circuit, thereby coupling hippocampal sharp wave-ripples and theta rhythms across different brain states.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The subiculum forms part of a circuit that influences oscillatory patterns in the granular retrosplenial cortex (gRSC). Specifically, high-frequency oscillations (~150 Hz) in the gRSC can be driven through a hippocampus–subiculum pathway. Optogenetic experiments show that stimulation in upstream areas can induce HFOs in superficial layers of gRSC, and these oscillations become coupled with hippocampal sharp wave-ripples and theta rhythms. Through these recurrent interactions, the subiculum contributes to a loop involving the hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, and entorhinal cortex, potentially coordinating memory-related or navigational signals across different brain states (rest vs. active exploration).

## 3. **Relaying Oscillatory and Topographical Information to the Mammillary Bodies**

**Function:**  
Conveys topographically organized hippocampal output (theta, ripple, and slow oscillations) to the mammillary bodies (MBOs), which supports memory formation and spatial navigation roles mediated by the hypothalamic circuitry.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The subiculum provides major hippocampal outputs to the mammillary bodies, a group of hypothalamic nuclei integral to memory formation and spatial navigation. These subicular inputs are topographically organized; different subicular cell populations convey distinct oscillatory signatures (theta, ripple, slow oscillations) to different subdivisions of the MBOs. This diversified input presumably helps the MBOs orchestrate their role in encoding spatial memory and navigation, as lesions or disruptions here are associated with anterograde amnesia. A study employing silicon probe recordings across the subiculum and MBOs highlights how subicular drive shapes the electrophysiological heterogeneity observed within MBO neurons.

## 4. **Modulation of Alert-Driven Accelerated Locomotion**

**Function:**  
Mediates alert-driven, high-speed locomotion (e.g., escape behaviors) via histaminergic input from the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), linking arousal states to rapid motor output.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
A subiculum circuit, specifically receiving histaminergic input from the TMN, is necessary for alert-driven acceleration of locomotion. In basal conditions, activating the TMN–subiculum circuit can facilitate a shift from low-speed to high-speed movement, but under alert or stressful circumstances, this circuit becomes indispensable for rapid locomotor acceleration. Histamine released from TMN neurons targets the subiculum via H2 receptors on glutamatergic cells that, in turn, project to the retrosplenial granular cortex. This newly identified pathway illuminates the subiculum’s role in emotion- or arousal-driven motor responses.
