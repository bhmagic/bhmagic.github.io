## 1. **Spatial Memory and Cognitive Mapping**

**Function:**  
Spatial Memory and Cognitive Mapping

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
A core function of the entorhinal cortex (particularly the medial entorhinal cortex, MEC) and other retrohippocampal areas (postrhinal, retrosplenial) is to provide a spatial framework or “map” for navigation and memory. Neurons such as grid cells, head direction cells, and boundary cells in the entorhinal cortex collectively generate an internal representation of space. By encoding positional, directional, and boundary-related cues, these circuits help the hippocampus form place fields. Over time, learning and plasticity refine these spatial codes into consistent maps that underlie effective memory-guided navigation. Disruptions in these areas compromise the fidelity of spatial representation and thereby impair the ability to remember or navigate environments.

## 2. **Working Memory**

**Function:**  
Working Memory Support

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Beyond long-term spatial mapping, the retrohippocampal circuitry, especially entorhinal–hippocampal networks, is crucial for holding transient information online—i.e., working memory. Medial entorhinal input helps the hippocampus track recent past and immediate future choices, sometimes reflected in “splitter” or prospective/retrospective place fields. Mechanisms involving presynaptic signaling pathways (e.g., Rac1) also modulate working memory processes, distinguishing these short-term functions from longer-term memory consolidation in the hippocampus and related cortical areas.

## 3. **Emotional Regulation and Affective States**

**Function:**  
Modulation of Mood, Anxiety, and Depression

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Although traditionally viewed in the context of memory and navigation, the retrohippocampal region (including the entorhinal cortex) also contributes to emotional regulation. Disruptions in entorhinal or hippocampal circuitry, particularly in neurotransmitter systems (e.g., norepinephrine, serotonin), can alter anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Restoring normal innervation and activity patterns in these areas (via antidepressants or other means) can alleviate mood dysfunction, illustrating the broader role of entorhinal–hippocampal circuits in both cognitive and affective domains.

## 4. **Memory Consolidation (including Sleep Reactivation)**

**Function:**  
Sleep-Related Memory Reactivation and Consolidation

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
During non-REM (NREM) sleep, neural ensembles in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus “reactivate” recent experiences to consolidate memory traces. These replays are often coordinated with transient oscillations such as isolated theta waves or sharp-wave ripples. The retrosplenial and entorhinal cortices, alongside key thalamic inputs, contribute to triggering or synchronizing this reactivation. Effective reactivation strengthens recently formed memories and is critical for long-term memory stability.

**Articles mentioning this function:**  
- [PMID:39455583](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39455583/)

## 5. **Multi-Sensory Association and Cross-Modal Plasticity**

**Function:**  
Cross-Modal Associative Learning

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and other retrohippocampal structures do not only process spatial cues but also integrate multimodal information (e.g., visual, auditory) to form richer memory representations. By coordinating with sensory cortices, the entorhinal cortex helps establish long-term associations across modalities (visuo-auditory, in this instance). Such plastic changes depend on neuropeptides like cholecystokinin (CCK), released from entorhinal afferents, enabling enduring cortical plasticity for cross-modal memory.

- [PMID:38436304](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38436304/)

**Articles studying this function (examples):**  
- **[PMID:38436304](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38436304/)** – *Heterosynaptic plasticity of the visuo-auditory projection requires cholecystokinin released from entorhinal cortex afferents.*

**Articles proposing this function as new/novel mechanism:**  
- **[PMID:38436304](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38436304/)** – Identifies a novel requirement for CCK from entorhinal projections to support heterosynaptic plasticity between sensory cortices.

## 6. **High-Frequency Oscillations and Network Coordination**

**Function:**  
Oscillatory Coupling for Cognitive Processes

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Gamma oscillations (30–150 Hz), theta rhythms (~4–10 Hz), and high-frequency oscillations (~150 Hz) in retrosplenial and entorhinal circuits are pivotal for coordinating information flow during navigation, memory encoding, and recall. These rhythms dynamically couple to hippocampal activity—sometimes in layer-specific or phase-specific manners—to unify distinct inputs (e.g., from the medial septum or hypothalamus) into coherent representations. Such oscillatory complexity reflects nuanced functional states beyond classic sub-bands and is integral to cognition.

## 7. **Synaptic Plasticity Underlying Learning**

**Function:**  
Synaptic Plasticity (LTP, LTD, Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity)

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Learning in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex is fundamentally driven by changes in synaptic strength. These changes can be Hebbian (e.g., long-term potentiation, LTP) or non-Hebbian (e.g., heterosynaptic forms, spike-timing-dependent LTD). Recent findings highlight specialized roles for astrocytes in orchestrating these plasticity events (e.g., the requirement of glial signals for entorhinal–hippocampal LTD), as well as neuromodulators such as cholecystokinin. By enabling or restricting synaptic changes, these mechanisms shape memory and learning processes in the retrohippocampal region.

- **[PMID:38436304](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38436304/)** – *Heterosynaptic plasticity... requires cholecystokinin released from entorhinal cortex afferents.*  
- **[PMID:39541232](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39541232/)** – *Astrocytes mediate two forms of spike timing-dependent depression at entorhinal cortex–hippocampal synapses.*

## 8. **Episodic(-Like) Memory Encoding**

**Function:**  
Episodic-Like Memory Engram

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) contributes critical contextual and object-related information to the hippocampus, enabling the formation of episodic-like memories (where “what,” “where,” and “when” converge). During learning, certain ensembles of LEC neurons become active (engram cells). Re-activating these cells later can trigger recall of the original episode. Disrupting LEC engrams, conversely, impairs memory performance. This link highlights the LEC’s pivotal role in representing the elemental features of an “episode” and guiding subsequent retrieval in tasks such as object-place-context recognition.

## 9. **Predictive Sequence Learning and Error Signaling**

**Function:**  
Predictive Coding of Sensory Sequences

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Within the hippocampal formation, including entorhinal projections, the CA3 region and downstream CA1 can act as a predictive autoencoder, attempting to forecast upcoming inputs based on recent sequences. CA1 may detect prediction errors by comparing CA3’s output against direct entorhinal input. This mechanism helps the circuit adapt quickly to novel or changing sequences—an essential component of rapid learning. The underlying circuit motifs, including recurrent connections, might generalize across other thalamocortical or cortical circuits.

## 10. **Integration of Environmental Structure and Symmetry**

**Function:**  
Encoding of Geometric Features and Symmetry

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Whereas the entorhinal cortex is often linked to a global map, the retrosplenial (RSC) and postrhinal (POR) cortices can encode features of local geometry and environmental boundaries. These circuits process whether environments are symmetrical or have structural cues that guide navigation. POR head direction cells may invert their directional tuning with rotated landmarks, and RSC can represent local boundaries more granularly. Together, they provide distinct but complementary spatial reference frames for the hippocampal formation.

**Summary**  
Taken together, these studies converge on the retrohippocampal region’s essential roles in spatial representation, working memory, emotional regulation, and complex associative learning. Novel mechanisms include astrocyte-mediated plasticity at EC–hippocampal synapses, specific neuromodulators (hypocretin, cholecystokinin) that shape local oscillations and plasticity, and engram-based retrieval in the lateral entorhinal cortex. This evolving picture underscores the multifaceted functions of the retrohippocampal region in cognition and affect.
