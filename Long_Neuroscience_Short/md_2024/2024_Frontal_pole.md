## 1. **Limited or No Direct Influence on Response-Time Variability and Cognitive Flexibility**

**Function:**  
From lesion studies in macaque monkeys, bilateral damage to the frontopolar cortex (FPC) did **not** alter variability in response times or produce deficits in cognitive flexibility, in contrast to lesions in other prefrontal regions (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), which **did** affect these measures. This suggests that, at least within the specific task parameters tested, the frontal pole is **not** crucial for modulating trial-to-trial behavioral variability or for rapidly adapting to new cognitive rules. Instead, other parts of the frontal cortex (such as orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate) appear to be more directly involved in these specific behavioral processes.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Lesion experiments in macaques demonstrate that removing the FPC bilaterally has minimal impact on moment-to-moment changes in reaction time, as well as on the ability to switch strategies quickly when task demands change. This contrasts with lesions to the dorsolateral and anterior cingulate cortices, where robust effects on both response-time variability and cognitive flexibility were observed. Thus, the FPC’s role in executive functions may be more specialized, potentially involving higher-order reasoning or long-term goal processing, rather than momentary adjustments or rapid strategy switches.

## 2. **Encoding Learning Stage (Exploration vs. Exploitation) and Goal Representation During Fast Learning**

**Function:**  
Electrophysiological recordings from the frontopolar cortex (FPC) in macaque monkeys reveal that neurons track both the **learning phase** (exploration vs. exploitation) and the **goal** of an action. During fast one-trial learning, FPC neurons strongly encode the **chosen** target’s position at the time of acquisition; in contrast, the unchosen alternatives are **not** similarly represented. Once the target location is learned, this neural representation appears **even before** the target reappears, suggesting that FPC monitors or “keeps in mind” the upcoming goal. These findings refine the idea that the FPC guides exploratory behaviors by coordinating with other prefrontal areas but do **not** support the hypothesis that it evaluates multiple options in parallel; rather, it focuses on monitoring the chosen option and the stage of learning.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
During a rapid, single-trial learning paradigm, frontopolar cortex neurons specifically code the newly acquired goal location, showing heightened activity immediately following correct learning. This activity re-emerges predictively in subsequent trials, even before the target is presented, indicating a top-down bias or “pointer” toward the anticipated goal. Contrary to prior models suggesting that the FPC might simultaneously evaluate multiple strategies, these recordings imply a more selective, chosen-option-centric coding scheme. Thus, while the FPC collaborates with other prefrontal areas for broader explorations of strategy, its unique role may be to maintain and highlight the currently relevant goal once identified.

**Articles proposing this function as new/novel mechanism:**  
- **[PMID: 38363801](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38363801)** – Highlights a **novel** view of FPC activity in fast-learning paradigms, showing a specialized role in monitoring the chosen goal rather than evaluating all alternatives.
