## 1. **Bridging or Sustaining Information for Delayed Defensive (Escape) Responses**

**Function:**  
The claustrum (particularly the rostral-to-striatum portion, rsCla) is essential for “holding” or “bridging” information that supports a delayed escape behavior. When an animal must remember a threat cue and execute an escape response after a time delay, claustral neurons maintain persistent activity in the absence of ongoing sensory input.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Research using a “delayed escape task” in rats shows that rsCla activity remains elevated during the delay period—when the animal must remember and later perform an escape. Suppressing (inhibiting) claustrum activity early in this holding period diminishes both the sustained neuronal firing and the delayed escape behavior. This suggests that the claustrum serves as a critical link between the initial threat stimulus and a subsequent, postponed motor output, allowing rats to execute a delayed defensive response that is neither purely innate nor merely learned.

**Articles studying this function (examples):**  
- **PMID: [38324450](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38324450)** – Demonstrates that inhibiting claustral neurons disrupts delayed escape by preventing the sustained activity needed to “hold” threat-related information.

**Articles proposing this function as new/novel mechanism:**  
- **PMID: [38324450](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38324450)** – Highlights a novel role for the claustrum in orchestrating delayed defensive responses, expanding our understanding beyond a simple dichotomy of innate vs. learned behaviors.
