## 1. **Support of Spatial Memory and Cognitive Mapping**

**Function:**  
Facilitation of spatial memory formation and stable map-like representations of an environment, often via grid cells and other spatially tuned neurons. The EC (especially the medial entorhinal cortex, MEC) works together with the hippocampus to create and maintain a coherent “cognitive map” of external space.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The medial entorhinal cortex is well known for housing grid cells, which fire in a hexagonal pattern covering an environment. Through these spatially periodic cells and additional cell types (e.g., boundary vector cells), the EC encodes location and environmental features. Recurrent networks and inputs from the medial septum help organize these spatial codes into theta- and gamma-modulated ensembles. During learning, MEC representations stabilize into a consistent spatial map that can be used to guide behavior. Conversely, when entorhinal inputs are disrupted, place-related activity in the hippocampus is impaired. In disease models (e.g., Alzheimer’s), early dysfunction in the EC can lead to spatial memory deficits.

## 2. **Temporal Coding** and “Time Cells” for Interval/Sequence Representation

**Function:**  
Encoding and processing of temporal structure (e.g., intervals, time sequences) in parallel with spatial information, facilitating episodic-like memory that includes “when” events occur.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Beyond spatial grids, the entorhinal cortex also displays cell populations whose activity is modulated by time (sometimes called “time cells”). These neurons can fire at specific moments in a behavioral interval or sequence, effectively encoding the temporal context of an experience. Such temporal representations are hypothesized to be crucial for episodic memory, allowing the formation of a memory trace that includes not only “where” (space) but also “when” (time). Recent studies show that the medial entorhinal cortex can modulate its firing patterns across learning, and that disruptions of entorhinal input can impair the ability to discriminate or learn temporal intervals.

## 3. **Working Memory** and Short-Term Trajectory Encoding

**Function:**  
Maintaining or influencing working memory, including short-term encoding of upcoming or previous paths (e.g., splitter cells in the hippocampus that rely on entorhinal input).

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
In addition to its well-known roles in long-term episodic memory, the EC (particularly MEC) helps sustain working memory processes within the hippocampal formation. When animals perform short-delay tasks that require remembering immediate past or future choices, a subset of CA1 place fields (“splitter fields”) can encode the upcoming trajectory. Studies find that shutting down MEC input reduces the number of these task-related splitter fields, leading to impaired performance in working memory tasks. This indicates that the EC provides crucial inputs for forming and updating short-term memory representations.

[**PMID: 38401118**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38401118), [**PMID: 39046788**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39046788)

*(None explicitly cited as “new” for working memory. The above studies provide novel insights.)*

## 4. **Reward-Related Coding** and Experience-Based Episodic Information

**Function:**  
Representation of experiential epochs (approach, consumption, departure) surrounding reward and linking “what” information (events, objects, rewards) with “where” information for goal-directed navigation.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) conveys “what” information crucial for episodic memories, often focusing on features like objects and rewarding events. During reward-based spatial tasks, certain LEC neuron populations selectively fire before, during, or after reward consumption, effectively segmenting the experience into distinct epochs. By shifting firing patterns quickly when reward location changes, these cells help animals learn the new reward site. Disrupting LEC function impairs this ability, underscoring its necessity for dynamic encoding of motivationally relevant experiences.

## 5. **Cross-Modal and Sensory Integration**

**Function:**  
Combining and transforming various sensory signals (visual, auditory, etc.) into memory-related representations. This includes heterosynaptic plasticity across visuo-auditory pathways with entorhinal contributions.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Although the EC is best known for spatial coding, it is also a critical hub for integrating non-spatial sensory inputs. The lateral entorhinal pathway carries object and possibly other modalities, while the medial entorhinal pathway is more spatially tuned. Some studies demonstrate that entorhinal CCK release (or local microcircuits) is essential for plastic changes linking visual with auditory cues in the cortex. Similarly, direct inputs from the secondary visual cortex (or retrosplenial cortex) to MEC can influence how visual information is integrated into spatial navigation circuits.

## 6. **Network Oscillations** and **Synaptic Plasticity**

**Function:**  
Generation or modulation of key network oscillations (theta, gamma, high-frequency oscillations) and driving synaptic plasticity in hippocampal-cortical circuits.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The EC is tightly interconnected with the hippocampus, supporting oscillatory synchronization (e.g., gamma, theta, ripples) critical for memory consolidation, coding of space, and replay events. Neurons and interneuron networks in the entorhinal cortex engage in gamma oscillations that can be scaled by neuromodulators (like hypocretin/orexin). Theta waves from or through the MEC can trigger replays during sleep. Some articles also highlight how entorhinal afferents enable forms of heterosynaptic or spike timing–dependent plasticity in downstream circuits, further underscoring the EC’s pivotal role in memory-network dynamics.

## 7. **Affective Regulation** (Anxiety/Depression Circuitry)

**Function:**  
Potential involvement in modulating emotional states, stress responses, or anxiety/depression phenotypes (often as part of a broader limbic circuit with hippocampus and amygdala).

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Though less commonly emphasized than its memory-related roles, the entorhinal cortex can participate in regulating affective behaviors. In fluoxetine-resistant depression models, deficits in immediate early gene expression (e.g., FosB+) in the entorhinal cortex correlate with anxious/depressive phenotypes. Restoration of noradrenergic innervation or other neuromodulatory inputs can correct these deficits. Such findings hint that the EC may help integrate or modulate mood states, possibly via gating of cortical-limbic signals.

## 8. **Early Vulnerability in Alzheimer’s Disease** (AD) and Related Pathologies

**Function:**  
The entorhinal cortex is one of the earliest regions to exhibit pathological changes (e.g., tau, amyloid) in AD, showing hyperexcitability, vascular deficits, and synaptic vulnerabilities that lead to memory impairment.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Clinical and basic research consistently point to the EC—particularly layer II neurons—as a site of earliest tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease. Studies demonstrate altered cerebrovascular flow, hyperexcitability, and progressive degenerative changes that compromise memory circuits. The EC also shows distinct changes in isoform expression (e.g., alternative splicing for APP or tau-related genes). Restoring normal excitability or vascular function in entorhinal neurons is a growing focus to prevent or slow disease progression.
