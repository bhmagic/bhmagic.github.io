## 1) Function: Regulation of auditory processing

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The striatum is not only involved in motor and reward circuits but can also modulate sensory inputs, including auditory information. Recent findings highlight that parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the **tail of the striatum** contribute to shaping how auditory signals are processed. These specific interneurons receive dense auditory input (particularly from the medial geniculate body) and, in turn, provide inhibitory control over spiny projection neurons (SPNs). By regulating SPN activity, striatal PV interneurons help refine receptive fields, enhance temporal precision of sound responses, and modulate the gain of auditory signals. This suggests that the tail of the striatum plays a more direct role in sensory (auditory) behaviors than previously recognized.

## 2) Function: Integration of excitatory/inhibitory signals in social and ASD-like behaviors

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The striatum, encompassing the **nucleus accumbens** and **caudate putamen**, is central to regulating social behavior and motivation. In the context of neurodevelopmental and stress-related disorders (like autism spectrum disorder, ASD), striatal circuits show altered expression of genes governing both excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) neurotransmission. Prenatal stress can exaggerate these molecular imbalances, leading to social deficits and repetitive-like behaviors in mice. Striatal dysfunction in excitatory/inhibitory balance is thus a candidate mechanism for ASD-relevant phenotypes and other social behavior impairments.

## 3) Function: Encoding single-limb gait and motor control

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The striatum is traditionally known for its pivotal role in initiating and coordinating movements. Recent research delves deeper by demonstrating that **both D1 and D2 receptor-expressing spiny projection neurons** in the dorsal striatum exhibit “phase-locked” activity to the individual limb’s stepping cycle. This fine-grained control underscores the striatum’s role in shaping not just broad locomotor patterns but also the precise rhythmic patterns of single-limb gait. In Parkinsonian or dopamine-depleted states, there is abnormal synchronization or exaggerated phase-locking in D2 MSNs, potentially contributing to gait disturbances.  

**Articles mentioning the function:**

## 4) Function: Associative learning and encoding cue–action–outcome relationships

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Striatal dopamine signals have long been implicated in associative learning, particularly in reinforcing beneficial actions and predicting rewards. Beyond simple stimulus–response patterns, new research shows that striatal dopamine can track more sophisticated internal models of “who/what is controlling the outcome,” dynamically updating when contingencies change. These dopamine-driven prediction errors help mice learn and unlearn cue–action–reward linkages. When task rules shift, dopamine signals transiently reset expectation and then re-establish precise coupling between cues, actions, and outcome value.  

**Articles mentioning the function:**

**Articles studying this function:**  
- **PMID: 38291283**: *Striatal dopamine signals reflect perceived cue-action-outcome associations in mice.*

## 5) Function: Circuit involvement in chronic pain, negative affect, and alcohol use

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The **dorsolateral striatum (DLS)** receives projections from the anterior insular cortex (AIC) that can govern motivated behaviors, including consumption of substances like alcohol. Chronic pain states can heighten negative emotional tone, which in turn might alter or amplify alcohol-related maladaptive behaviors. Research shows that AIC→DLS neurons exhibit heightened excitability under chronic pain plus binge-alcohol conditions, suggesting that stress/pain states can hijack striatal circuits to drive excessive consumption or anxiety-like outcomes. Understanding these AIC–striatal mechanisms could clarify comorbid pain and addiction disorders.  

**Articles mentioning the function:**

- **PMID: 38453466** (provides direct electrophysiological evidence for how pain and alcohol co-regulate striatal circuitry via AIC inputs).

## 6) Function: Regulation and generation of compulsive behaviors

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Within the striatum, spiny projection neurons (SPNs) are segregated into two primary pathways: the direct (D1) pathway and the indirect (D2) pathway. A growing body of work shows that hyperactivity within the **indirect pathway** (i.e., D2-SPNs) can drive compulsive phenotypes, such as excessive grooming, akin to behaviors seen in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Conversely, modulating these neurons can alleviate compulsive actions. This underscores the striatum’s critical balance of the “Go/No-Go” pathways in shaping not only adaptive habits but also maladaptive, compulsive ones.  

**Articles mentioning the function:**

- **PMID: 38536818** (highlights a direct link between excessive D2-pathway activity and pathological compulsions).

## 7) Function: Maintaining blood–brain barrier integrity and healthy myelination

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Although widely studied for its roles in action selection and reward, the striatum also shows distinct **cellular vulnerabilities** in conditions that disrupt the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and myelin. Research indicates that oligodendrocyte-derived laminin-γ1 is essential for BBB stability in the cortex and striatum. When laminin-γ1 is depleted in oligodendrocytes, mice exhibit region-specific BBB breakdown, highlighting the striatum as a site prone to vascular permeability changes. This phenomenon reveals an often-overlooked facet of striatal biology: the importance of glial and extracellular matrix components in maintaining neuronal function and structural integrity.

**Articles studying this function:**  
- **PMID: 38635399**: *Oligodendrocyte-derived laminin-γ1 regulates the blood-brain barrier and CNS myelination in mice.*

- **PMID: 38635399** (uncovers a glial-driven mechanism crucial for striatal BBB homeostasis).

## 8) Function: Cholinergic interneuron control of dopamine release and motivation

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Within the striatum, **cholinergic interneurons** (often called TANs—tonically active neurons) powerfully modulate local circuits and dopamine release. In particular, in the **nucleus accumbens** (the ventral striatal region), cholinergic interneurons can gate dopamine release that underpins motivation and reward seeking. This interplay is fundamental for cost–benefit evaluations, sustaining goal-directed behaviors. Recent debate has surrounded the exact in vivo effect that striatal acetylcholine has on dopamine transients (e.g., whether synchronous cholinergic firing can directly trigger dopamine release). Nevertheless, converging evidence suggests that cholinergic interneurons shape motivational drives via finely tuning dopaminergic signaling.  

**Articles mentioning the function:**

**Articles studying this function:**  
- **PMID: 38748470**: *Comment on 'Accumbens cholinergic interneurons dynamically promote dopamine release and enable motivation'.*
