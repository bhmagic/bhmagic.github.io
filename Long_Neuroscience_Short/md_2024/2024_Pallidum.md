## 1. **Regulation of Cocaine-Induced Behavioral Plasticity**

**Function:**  
The external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) serves as a critical “gatekeeper” within basal ganglia circuits, modulating cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The GPe is positioned to influence the reinforcing or maladaptive effects of cocaine by regulating downstream pathways. Parvalbumin-positive neurons in the GPe can either facilitate or constrain the transition from acute to chronic addictive states, depending on their molecular and circuit-level changes. The identified mechanisms in these neurons underscore how finely tuned GPe function shapes the course of drug-related behaviors. Disruptions or alterations in GPe signaling can thus have profound impacts on cocaine addiction phenotypes.

## 2. **Critical Role in Motivated Behaviors**

**Function:**  
The ventral pallidum (VP) is integral to diverse motivated behaviors, including reward seeking, reinforcement learning, and goal-directed tasks.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Single-nucleus transcriptomic analyses in mice and primates reveal substantial molecular diversity among VP neurons, suggesting specialized subpopulations that differentially process dopaminergic, cholinergic, and other neuromodulatory signals. Such heterogeneity positions the VP to orchestrate affective and motivational states across various contexts. These insights refine traditional views of how ventral pallidal circuits integrate multiple inputs to shape reward-related and goal-driven behaviors.

**Note:** Other abstracts in the dataset emphasize amygdala-, cortex-, or striatum-centered functions and do not explicitly address the globus pallidus. The two entries above (PMID: 39153478 and PMID: 39672784) are the only ones specifically discussing Pallidum-related function.
