## 1. **Post-stroke Plasticity and Network Reorganization in Visual Areas**

**Function:**  
Visual cortex undergoes network reorganization after ischemic injury and contributes to brain-wide recovery circuits, indicating that “visual” regions are not merely passive but can support sensorimotor improvements post-stroke.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The visual cortex participates in large-scale neuronal network reorganization following ischemic injury. Even when the stroke primarily affects motor or sensory regions, bilateral visual cortices can show disrupted functional connectivity. Inhibiting maladaptive glutamate receptor mechanisms (for example, mGluR5) aids in restoring overall network balance, suggesting that visual cortical areas are integral to whole-brain recovery. This indicates that vision-related cortex can reorganize to support sensorimotor improvements and that combined treatments (pharmacological plus rehabilitative training) leverage plasticity in visual areas to enhance functional recovery post-stroke.

## 2. **Short-Latency Temporal Integration and Backward Masking**

**Function:**  
Primary visual cortex (V1) mediates the short time windows required for perceiving rapidly changing stimuli, including backward masking effects where a trailing stimulus disrupts the perception of a preceding target.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Primary visual cortex (V1) underlies the temporal integration required for detecting brief or rapidly changing visual signals. Backward masking—where a trailing stimulus interferes with the perception of a preceding target—requires intact V1 activity in both mice and humans. Electrophysiological and optogenetic studies show that V1’s initial spike trains can represent a brief target; however, subsequent overlapping cortical activity (from the masking stimulus) degrades recognition. By suppressing V1 activity around the time of the mask, accurate perception and behavioral performance can be rescued, confirming the essential role of V1 in time-dependent visual processing.

## 3. **Disinhibition and Adult Plasticity in the Visual Cortex**

**Function:**  
Even in adulthood, the visual cortex retains capacity for plasticity, partly through reducing inhibitory interneuron activity (e.g., by subanesthetic ketamine), which can unmask latent excitatory remodeling.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
The adult visual cortex remains capable of plasticity, partly through regulation of cortical inhibition. Pharmacological interventions (e.g., subanesthetic ketamine) can induce disinhibition, specifically reducing the drive onto inhibitory interneurons, thereby enhancing excitatory plasticity. This lowers the inhibitory “gate” that often limits synaptic remodeling in adulthood. Studies show changes at the level of excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic currents, revealing that neuromodulators and drugs can unmask latent cortical plasticity even in older animals. This phenomenon may have implications for treating psychiatric, neurologic, or ophthalmic disorders characterized by reduced plasticity.

**Articles proposing this function as new/novel mechanism:**  
- [**PMID: 38164560**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38164560) – Shows that delivering ketamine intranasally selectively diminishes PV+ interneuron excitation in V1, highlighting a novel route to trigger adult cortical plasticity.

## 4. **Recurrent Circuit Dynamics Shaping Visual Perception**

**Function:**  
Recurrent loops of excitation and inhibition in visual cortex refine stimulus representations, enhancing or suppressing inputs to produce phenomena like orientation tuning and winner-take-all dynamics.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Recurrent connectivity within visual cortex fine-tunes the encoding of visual features by amplifying or suppressing inputs. Experiments and computational modeling both indicate that neurons in V1 (and higher tiers) form recurrent loops, wherein excitatory microcircuits drive local inhibition and, in turn, sculpt the final spiking output. These interactions help refine orientation/direction tuning, suppress distractors, and sharpen overall sensory representations. Recurrent processing can produce emergent phenomena such as winner-take-all dynamics for orientation selection and generate flexible responses that are modulated by context or behavioral state.

## 5. **Experience-Dependent Plasticity of Inhibitory Circuits and Arousal Modulation**

**Function:**  
Visual cortical interneurons (e.g., chandelier cells, PV+ cells) adapt to novel experiences, linking inhibitory plasticity to global arousal signals and shaping how repeated stimuli are processed.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Visual cortical interneurons, including chandelier cells and parvalbumin (PV+) interneurons, adapt their structure and function with experience. Novel or behaviorally salient events (like visuomotor mismatch) trigger robust responses in inhibitory cells, linking changes in interneuron excitability to global arousal signals. Repeated exposure to the same visual environment modifies inhibitory neuron bouton size, axonal structure, and excitatory–inhibitory balance, suggesting a circuit mechanism for how experience reconfigures cortical processing. This plasticity helps calibrate responses to relevant stimuli while suppressing stable or predictable visual signals.

- [**PMID: 38192196**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38192196) – Demonstrates that repeated virtual tunnel exposure alters chandelier cell outputs, reconfiguring excitatory neuron activity in layer 2/3—a novel substrate for visual experience-driven plasticity.

## 6. **Face-Selective Processing and Active Gaze Control**

**Function:**  
High-level visual areas in the temporal lobe (face patches) not only encode facial features but also drive saccadic patterns, guiding how primates actively scan faces.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
High-level visual areas in the temporal lobe contain neurons highly specialized for face processing. When these face-selective neurons are pharmacologically or optogenetically inactivated, primates exhibit altered patterns of eye movements—particularly neglecting contralateral facial features. These findings point to a causal link between face patches in inferior temporal cortex and saccadic choice for scanning socially relevant stimuli like faces. Thus, beyond passively encoding facial identity or expression, face-selective patches play an active role in orienting gaze to gather crucial visual information.

**Articles proposing this function as new/novel mechanism:**  
- [**PMID: 38198528**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38198528) – Offers causal evidence that output of face patches in visual cortex is mandatory for typical scanning strategies of faces.

## 7. **Preserving Visual Performance Across Fixations (Common Coverage)**

**Function:**  
Despite frequent saccadic eye movements, the visual cortex sustains a stable representation of the scene, ensuring each fixation yields incremental, nonredundant information.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Primates and other mammals make frequent saccadic eye movements, yet the visual system must preserve a stable understanding of the scene. Despite very different eye-movement strategies (e.g., whisking in rodents, saccades in primates), the visual cortex across species achieves comparable “coverage” of the environment. In essence, populations of neurons adapt so that repeated fixation (or sampling) integrates novel spatial information while ignoring redundant inputs. This phenomenon ensures that each fixation adds incremental knowledge—allowing efficient visual continuity in active vision.

**Articles mentioning this function:**  
- [**PMID: 38164577**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38164577)

**Articles studying this function (examples):**

**Articles proposing this function as new/novel mechanism:**  
- [**PMID: 38164577**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38164577) – Argues that local adaptation in cortical neurons and motor-sampling patterns coevolved to ensure a near-universal coverage scheme across mammals.

## 8. **Network States, Trial-by-Trial Variability, and Criticality in the Visual Cortex**

**Function:**  
V1 responses exhibit structured variability that scales with cortical area, aligning with theoretical “critical dynamics” where the system is optimally poised for sensory responsiveness.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Neuronal ensembles in V1 exhibit variable responses across repeated stimulus presentations. This “trial-by-trial variability” is structured, often correlating with ongoing brain-wide fluctuations. Recent large-scale recordings show that this variability scales with cortical area, matching theoretical predictions of a system near critical dynamics. That is, spontaneous fluctuations can reflect a critical, fluctuation-dominated state that enhances the system’s responsiveness to sensory input. Thus, the visual cortex may operate near a boundary that balances reliable stimulus representation with maximal sensitivity to changes.

## 9. **Late Plasticity Induction in Adult Visual Cortex via Noninvasive Stimulation**

**Function:**  
Despite the end of the “critical period,” adult V1 can still undergo plastic changes, exemplified by transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) inducing long-term synaptic modifications.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Beyond the classical “critical period,” the adult visual cortex can still undergo plastic changes, though these are often limited. Emerging work shows that transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) can induce lasting synaptic modifications, such as long-term depression (LTD) at thalamocortical synapses in V1. This technique capitalizes on moderate activation of cortical networks without overshadowing them, creating conditions under which adult circuits can still reorganize. These findings open avenues for reversing visual deficits even later in life, positioning LIFU as a potential therapeutic tool.

## 10. **Crossmodal Sensory Integration in Visual Cortex**

**Function:**  
Primary visual areas can integrate nonvisual signals (auditory, somatosensory) under certain conditions, supporting multisensory or mismatch detection processes typically not limited to “visual” inputs alone.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Contrary to the view that V1 processes only visual signals, multiple studies confirm crossmodal responses, especially in mice. For instance, studies show heterosynaptic plasticity at visuo-auditory projections or involvement of visual cortex in multisensory mismatch detection. Such crossmodal processing suggests the primary visual cortex can integrate or gate auditory (or other sensory) information under specific tasks. This phenomenon may unify extraretinal signals (e.g., from audition or somatosensation) with visual representations, possibly facilitating sharper or flexible behavioral responses (e.g., detecting movement onset or modulating sensory weighting in complex contexts).

## 11. **Feature Selectivity (Orientation, Motion, Shape) and Hierarchical Representation**

**Function:**  
Visual areas progressively encode object features, from local orientation/direction in V1 to more complex shapes and faces in IT, forming hierarchical representations critical for perception.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
A core function of visual areas is to process object features: orientation, direction of motion, and complex patterns. Multiple studies show that V1 populations form continuous orientation representations (rather than discrete clusters) and that higher visual areas (like V4, IT) encode more advanced shapes, faces, or color patterns. Motion selectivity can originate in specialized subpopulations of RGCs or subcortical stations, then be transformed in cortex. Hierarchical models indicate that lower areas (V1) emphasize local orientation/direction signals, while mid-level areas (V4) integrate forms or textures, and high-level (IT) areas encode face identity or shape. Disturbances (e.g., retromer dysfunction, aging, or disease models) can degrade these representations.

## 12. **Visual Cortex Involvement in Aging, Retromer Function, and Neuroprotection**

**Function:**  
Age-related decline in connectivity and synaptic efficiency can be mitigated by maintaining retromer stability in visual cortical neurons, delaying pathology and preserving function.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Visual areas, like other cortical regions, can exhibit age-related changes in connectivity and synaptic efficiency. Work on retromer stability—key for cellular trafficking—shows that it is crucial for neuronal health, delaying aging-related pathology and preserving visual function. Mutations or reduced expression of retromer-related genes cause misrouting of proteins and lipids that degrade cortical function. Enhancing retromer pathways or associated proteins (e.g., OXR1) in adult or aging animals can rescue visual decline, underscoring the role of the visual cortex as an accessible model to study neuroprotective strategies.

## 13. **Detection, Contrast Processing, and Luminance Signals in V1 Versus Subcortical Circuits**

**Function:**  
While V1 is critical for detecting fine contrast changes, subcortical structures (e.g., superior colliculus) can handle simpler luminance-based detection, illustrating parallel visual pathways.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
While the primary visual cortex is central for many aspects of conscious visual discrimination, subcortical structures (especially the superior colliculus) can also perform robust detection tasks. Recent work in mice shows that contrast detection strongly depends on V1 spiking output, whereas luminance detection often relies more heavily on the superior colliculus. This functional dissociation underscores that “visual detection” can be served by parallel pathways. During a detection trial, V1 or SC can be inactivated optogenetically to parse out each structure’s specific contributions, revealing that cortical computations are especially critical for detecting subtle contrast changes.

- [**PMID: 38640924**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38640924) – Provides direct evidence that cortical activity is essential for contrast detection but not for simple luminance-based detection, revealing a division of labor between V1 and SC.

## 14. **Crowding, Contextual Illusions, and Grouping in Mid-Level Visual Cortex**

**Function:**  
Mid-level areas (e.g., V4) refine target recognition under clutter via interactions that exceed simple pooling, shaping phenomena like crowding and contextual illusions.

**Description (5–10 lines):**  
Visual crowding occurs when a target is flanked by nearby stimuli, making identification difficult. While crowding has classically been attributed to pooling in early visual cortex, new data from mid-level areas (e.g., V4) suggest more complex interactions. Single V4 neurons exhibit distinctive modulations by distractors, which can unify or suppress target-specific signals depending on salience and attention. Instead of simple pooling, neuronal responses vary with target–distractor similarity and top-down factors such as attention. Thus, the mid-level cortex refines shape or object signals under clutter, implicating recurrent feedback or lateral circuits that go beyond naive feedforward models.

- [**PMID: 38670806**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38670806) – Demonstrates that crowding arises from complex excitatory–inhibitory and recurrent interactions in mid-level visual cortex, rather than mere spatial averaging.
